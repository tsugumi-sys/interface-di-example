# Practive of Dependency Inversion & Injection

## What?

The codes to practice dependency inversion & injection in TypeScript.

## Why?

I want a minimal example of dependency inversion & injection to understand well.

## How?

You can try in order from `step1.ts`.

1. `step1.ts`: You need to implement dependency inversion so that the domain is not tightly coupled to the repository.
2. `step2.ts`: You need to implement dependency injection.
3. `step3.ts`: The final code.
